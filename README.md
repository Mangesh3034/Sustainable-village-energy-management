Sustainable Energy Management
Description-Rural areas often face challenges in accessing reliable and sustainable energy sources. There's a need for solutions that promote clean and efficient energy usage. Design a solution to optimize energy consumption in villages by implementing smart grids and renewable energy sources. The system should monitor energy usage, predict demand patterns, and integrate solar/wind energy for sustainable power generation.
Input-Data on energy consumption patterns, Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or biomass, Smart grid infrastructure.
Output-Energy monitoring system for efficient consumption, Implementation of renewable energy sources. Smart grid management for optimized distribution, Energy usage reports, predictions for peak demand, and recommendations for optimizing energy consumption.
